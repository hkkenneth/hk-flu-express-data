The latest surveillance data showed that the overall influenza activity had peaked 
in mid‐February and started to decrease thereafter. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU)

there were 67 cases of influenza associated ICU admissions or deaths, in which 42 
of them were fatal. 
As the winter influenza season is expected to last for a few more weeks, target 
groups are advised to make use of the last opportunity to receive influenza 
vaccinations.

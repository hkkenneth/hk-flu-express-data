The overall influenza activity remained at the baseline level.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy
persons. Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable

Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a
kindergarten or child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or
above), who are eligible, can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from
enrolled private doctors participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy
schemes starting from Oct 6, 2014.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 36, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 3.4 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza-like illness surveillance among
sentinel private doctors, 2012-14
In week 36, the average consultation rate for ILI
among sentinel private doctors was 33.3 ILI cases

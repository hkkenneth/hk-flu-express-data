and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jul 30, 2014)
Reporting period: Jul 20 – 26, 2014 (Week 30)

The overall influenza activity in past few weeks has decreased when compared to that in
mid-June.
The CHP has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and private hospitals to reactivate
the enhanced surveillance of influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths aged 18 years or above since Jun 23. As of Jul 30, there were 23 cases of influenza
associated ICU admission, in which 12 of them were fatal.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 30, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 4.5 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza-like illness surveillance among
sentinel private doctors, 2012-14
In week 30, the average consultation rate for ILI
among sentinel private doctors was 31.3 ILI cases
per 1,000 consultations (Figure 2).

30, 123 (7.1%) were tested positive for seasonal
influenza viruses, including 102 influenza A(H3)
viruses, 17 influenza B viruses and 4 influenza C

Influenza-like illness outbreak monitoring,
2013-14
In week 30, 3 ILI outbreaks occurring in
schools/institutions were recorded. In the first 4
days of week 31 (Jul 27 to 30, 2014), 2 ILI

group in accident and emergency
departments, 2012-14#
In week 30, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 133.0 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).
#Note: The influenza-like illness syndrome group includes codes such as
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and

Influenza associated hospital admission
rates and deaths based on discharge
coding, 2012-14
In week 30, hospital admission rates with principal
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0-4 years,
5-64 years and 65 years or above were 0.55, 0.02,
and 0.31 cases respectively (per 10,000 people in

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care
centres/ kindergartens, 2012-14
In week 29, 0.67% of children in the sentinel
child care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had
fever (Figure 8). The surveillance in week 30 was
suspended due to summer holiday.

KG, 2012-14

Fever surveillance at sentinel residential
care homes for the elderly, 2012-14
In week 30, 0.09% of residents in the sentinel
residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) had
fever (Figure 9).

2012-14
In week 30, the average consultation rate for ILI
among Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs)
was 2.52 ILI cases per 1,000 consultations
(Figure 10).

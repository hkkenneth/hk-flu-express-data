Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jan 21, 2015)
Reporting period: Jan 11 – 17, 2015 (Week 3)




The overall influenza activity has continued to increase. The predominating virus is
influenza A(H3N2).
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 2, 2015. As of Jan 21 noon, there were 70
cases of influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 31 were fatal cases.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 6,
2014.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2013-15
In week 3, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 7.2 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Rate of influenza-like illness syndrome
group in accident and emergency
departments, 2013-15#
In week 3, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 192.2 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).
#Note: The influenza-like illness syndrome group includes codes such as
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission
rates and deaths based on discharge
coding, 2013-15
In week 3, admission rates in public hospitals with
principal diagnosis of influenza for persons aged
0-4 years, 5-64 years and 65 years or above were
2.34, 0.21 and 2.45 cases (per 10,000 people in the
age group) respectively (Figure 7). Weekly number
of deaths with any diagnosis of influenza is also
shown in the figure on the right hand side.

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care
centres/ kindergartens, 2013-15
In week 3, 0.81% of children in the sentinel child
care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had fever
(38°C or above)(Figure 8).

Enhanced surveillance for severe seasonal influenza (Aged 18 years or above)


From Jan 14, 2015, 12:00 noon, to Jan 21, 2015, 12:00 noon, 33 cases of influenza associated ICU
admission/ death were recorded, in which 19 of them were fatal. In addition, two previously



In the United States (week ending Jan 10, 2015), the influenza activity remained at elevated levels,
with influenza A(H3N2) being the most predominating virus.
In Canada (week ending Jan 10, 2015), the influenza activity remained at a high level with seven
of the thirteen provinces and territories reporting widespread activity. Influenza A(H3N2)
continues to be the most common type of influenza viruses detected.
In the United Kingdom (week ending Jan 11, 2015), the weekly influenza-like illness consultation
rates increased in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Influenza A(H3N2) is the most
common type of influenza viruses detected.
In Europe (week ending Jan 11, 2015), the influenza season is underway. The number of countries
with increased influenza activity continued to rise and the proportion of influenza virus-positive
sentinel specimens increased to 28%. Influenza A(H3N2) is the predominant virus detected.
In Japan (week ending Jan 11, 2015), the influenza activity continued to increase. The average
number of reported ILI cases per sentinel site rose to 33.28. Influenza A(H3N2) is the most
common type of influenza viruses detected.

above), who are eligible, can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination 
from enrolled private doctors participating in the Government's vaccination 
subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2, 2013.

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012‐14 
In week 23, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 5.0 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

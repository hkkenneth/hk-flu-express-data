FLU EXPRESS
Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jan 15, 2014)
Reporting period: Jan 5 – 11, 2014 (Week 2) 




The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity continued to 
increase. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or 
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 3, 2014. As of Jan 15, there were 25 cases of 
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 9 of them were fatal. 
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high‐risk individuals and even healthy persons. 
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members 
of the public. 
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or 
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, 
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors 
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2, 
2013. 

Influenza‐like‐illness surveillance among 
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012‐14 
In week 2, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 5.5 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza‐like illness surveillance among 
sentinel private doctors, 2012‐14 
In week 2, the average consultation rate for ILI 
among sentinel private doctors was 43.8 ILI cases

Rate of influenza‐like illness syndrome 
group in accident and emergency 
departments, 2012‐14# 
In week 2, the rate of the influenza‐like illness 
syndrome group in the accident and emergency 
departments (AED) was 196.6 (per 1,000 coded 
cases) (Figure 6). 
#Note: The influenza‐like illness syndrome group includes codes such as 
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and 
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission 
rates and deaths based on discharge 
coding, 2012‐14 
In week 2, hospital admission rates with principal 
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0‐4 years, 
5‐64 years and 65 years or above were 2.47, 0.18 
and 0.58 cases respectively (per 10,000 people in 
the age group) (Figure 7). Weekly number of 
deaths with any diagnosis of influenza in public 
hospitals is also shown in the figure on the right 
hand side.

centres/ kindergartens, 2012‐14 
In week 2, 0.88% of children in the sentinel child 
care centres / kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had fever 
(Figure 8).

Enhanced Surveillance for Severe Seasonal Influenza (Aged 18 years or above) 


above one month and below 18 years) 


In week 2, two cases of severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication were 
reported. The first case was a 50‐day‐old boy who had developed shock and his 
nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested positive for influenza A(H1). Another case was a 
one‐year‐old boy who presented with fever and cough, and his nasopharyngeal aspirates 
were tested positive for influenza A(H1) and influenza B. Both cases are now in critical 
condition. In the first 4 days of week 3 (Jan 12 to 15, 2014), one case of severe paediatric 
influenza‐associated complication involving a 5‐year‐old boy was reported. He had 
developed pneumonia and was complicated with invasive pneumococcal disease. He is

Surveillance of Tamiflu resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection 


In week 2, there were no new reports of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistant influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. In the first 4 days of week 3 (Jan 12 to 15, 2014), there 
were two new reports of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus 
infection involving a 17‐month‐old boy and a 4‐year old boy were reported. They had 
been discharged. The virus strains detected were sensitive to zanamivir (Relenza). There 
are totally 41 reports of Tamiflu resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detected in Hong 
Kong since 2009. 

Global Situation of Influenza Activity


increase. 



In Canada (week ending Jan 4, 2014), the influenza activity continued to increase. 



In the United Kingdom (week ending Jan 5, 2014), the ILI consultation rate remained low. 



In Europe (week ending Jan 5, 2014), the influenza activity generally remained at low 
levels in the Region, but the ILI consultation rates in Spain, Portugal and Turkey had 
increased. 



In Singapore (week ending Jan 11, 2014), the number of consultations for acute 
respiratory infections was below the warning level.

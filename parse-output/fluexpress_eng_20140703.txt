FLU EXPRESS
Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jul 2, 2014)
Reporting period: Jun 22 – 28, 2014 (Week 26)

The overall influenza activity has decreased slightly when compared to the previous two
weeks but was still higher than that in May. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) will
continue to closely monitor the local influenza activity.
The CHP has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and private hospitals to reactivate
the enhanced surveillance of influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths aged 18 years or above since Jun 23. As of Jul 2, there were 6 cases of influenza
associated ICU admission, in which 2 of them were fatal.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 26, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 5.5 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza-like illness surveillance among
sentinel private doctors, 2012-14
In week 26, the average consultation rate for ILI
among sentinel private doctors was 41.7 ILI cases

influenza viruses, including 2 influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 131 influenza A(H3)

Influenza-like illness outbreak monitoring,
2013-14
In week 26, 4 ILI outbreaks occurring in
schools/institutions were recorded. In the first 4
days of week 27 (Jun 29 to Jul 2, 2014), no ILI

group in accident and emergency
departments, 2012-14#
In week 26, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 150.5 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).

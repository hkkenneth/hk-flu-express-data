Reporting period: Dec 29, 2013 – Jan 4, 2014 (Week 1) 
The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity has increased. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions or deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 3, 2014. As of Jan 8, there 
were 13 cases of influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 4 of them 
were fatal. 
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high‐risk individuals and even healthy 
persons. Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable 
for all members of the public. 
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a 
kindergarten or child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or 
above), who are eligible, can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from 
enrolled private doctors participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy 
schemes starting from Oct 2, 2013. 

Influenza‐like‐illness surveillance among 
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012‐14 
In week 1, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 3.4 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Percent positive for influenza viruses, 
2012‐13 
For the respiratory specimens received between 
Dec 23 to 29, 2013, 8.3% were tested positive for 
influenza viruses, including 2.3% influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09, 3.8% influenza A(H3) and 2.1%

group in accident and emergency 
departments, 2012‐14# 
In week 1, the rate of the influenza‐like illness 
syndrome group in the accident and emergency 
departments (AED) was 193.1 (per 1,000 coded 
cases) (Figure 6).

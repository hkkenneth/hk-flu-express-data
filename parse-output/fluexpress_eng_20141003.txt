above), who are eligible, can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from
enrolled private doctors participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 39, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 4.2 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

FLU EXPRESS
Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Apr 2, 2014)
Reporting period: Mar 23– 29, 2014 (Week 13) 





The latest surveillance data showed that the local activity of influenza A continued to 
decrease. However, the activity of influenza B is still at a relatively high level. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or 
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 3, 2014. As of Apr 2, there were 246 cases of 
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 120 of them were fatal. 
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high‐risk individuals and even healthy persons. 
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members 
of the public. 
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or 
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, 
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors 
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2, 
2013. 

Influenza‐like‐illness surveillance among 
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012‐14 
In week 13, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 6.2 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza‐like illness surveillance among 
sentinel private doctors, 2012‐14 
In week 13, the average consultation rate for ILI 
among sentinel private doctors was 47.8 ILI cases 
per 1,000 consultations (Figure 2).

Influenza virus detections (Laboratory 
surveillance), 2013‐14* 
For the respiratory specimens received in week 
13, 418 (16.5%) were tested positive for 
seasonal influenza viruses, including 61 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 53 influenza 
A(H3) viruses, 294 influenza B viruses and 10 
influenza C viruses (Figure 3). 
 
* Since Feb 10, 2014 (week 7), Public Health Laboratory Services 
Branch has adopted new genetic tests as the primary tests for 
various respiratory viruses, which are expected to be more 
sensitive than the methods used previously. This transition in 
laboratory techniques may bring about increases in detection of 
and percentage positive for influenza viruses.

Percentage positive for influenza viruses, 
2013‐14* 
Among the respiratory specimens received in 
week 13, 2.4% was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 
2.1% influenza A(H3), 11.6% influenza B and 
0.4% influenza C (Figure 4). 
* Since Feb 10, 2014 (week 7), Public Health Laboratory Services 
Branch has adopted new genetic tests as the primary tests for 
various respiratory viruses, which are expected to be more 
sensitive than the methods used previously. This transition in 
laboratory techniques may bring about increases in detection of 
and percentage positive for influenza viruses.

Influenza‐like illness outbreak monitoring, 
2013‐14 
In week 13, 9 ILI outbreaks occurring in schools/ 
institutions were recorded. In the first 4 days of 
week 14 (Mar 30 to Apr 2, 2014), 4 ILI outbreaks 
occurring in schools/ institutions were recorded 
(Figure 5).

Rate of influenza‐like illness syndrome 
group in accident and emergency 
departments, 2012‐14# 
In week 13, the rate of the influenza‐like illness 
syndrome group in the accident and emergency 
departments (AED) was 206.8 (per 1,000 coded 
cases) (Figure 6). 
#Note: The influenza‐like illness syndrome group includes codes such as 
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and 
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission 
rates and deaths based on discharge 
coding, 2012‐14 
In week 13, hospital admission rates with principal 
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0‐4 years, 
5‐64 years and 65 years or above were 1.20, 0.08 
and 0.56 cases respectively (per 10,000 people in 
the age group) (Figure 7). Weekly number of 
deaths with any diagnosis of influenza in public 
hospitals is also shown in the figure on the right 
hand side.

deaths, 2012‐14

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care 
centres/ kindergartens, 2012‐14 
In week 13, 1.14% of children in the sentinel 
child care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had 
fever (Figure 8).

KG, 2012‐14

Fever surveillance at sentinel residential 
care homes for the elderly, 2012‐14

Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jan 7, 2015)
Reporting period: Dec 28, 2014 – Jan 3, 2015 (Week 1)

The overall influenza activity continued to increase.
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 2, 2015. As of Jan 7, there were 15 cases of
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 2 of them were fatal.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 6,
2014.

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2013-15
In week 1, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 5.3 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza-like illness surveillance among
sentinel private doctors, 2013-15
In week 1, the average consultation rate for ILI
among sentinel private doctors was 39.5 ILI cases

week 1, 442 (14.40%) were tested positive for
seasonal influenza viruses, including 418
influenza A(H3), 18 influenza B and 6 influenza C
(Figure 3).

Percentage positive for influenza viruses,
2014-15
Among the respiratory specimens received in
week 1, 13.62% was influenza A(H3), 0.59%
influenza B and 0.19% influenza C (Figure 4).

Influenza-like illness outbreak monitoring,
2014-15
In week 1, 8 ILI outbreaks occurring in schools/
institutions were recorded. In the first 4 days of
week 2 (Jan 4 to 7, 2015), 8 ILI outbreaks occurring
in schools/ institutions were recorded (Figure 5).

Rate of influenza-like illness syndrome
group in accident and emergency
departments, 2013-15#
In week 1, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 183.4 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).
#Note: The influenza-like illness syndrome group includes codes such as
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission
rates and deaths based on discharge
coding, 2013-15
In week 1, hospital admission rates with principal
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0-4 years,
5-64 years and 65 years or above were 0.66, 0.08
and 0.90 cases (per 10,000 people in the age group)
respectively (Figure 7). Weekly number of deaths
with any diagnosis of influenza in public hospitals
is also shown in the figure on the right hand side.

deaths, 2013-15

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care
centres/ kindergartens, 2012-14
In week 51, 2014, 0.67% of children in the
sentinel child care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/
KG) had fever (Figure 8). The surveillance in week
52, 2014 - week 1, 2015 was suspended due to
Christmas and New Year holiday.

KG, 2012-14

Fever surveillance at sentinel residential
care homes for the elderly, 2013-15
In week 1, 0.13% of residents in the sentinel
residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) had
fever (Figure 9).

sentinel Chinese medicine practitioners,
2013-15
In week 1, the average consultation rate for ILI
among Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs)
was 2.60 ILI cases per 1,000 consultations
(Figure 10).

Enhanced Surveillance for Severe Seasonal Influenza (Aged 18 years or above)


From Jan 2, 2015, 12:00 noon, to Jan 7, 2015, 12:00 noon, 15 cases of influenza associated
ICU admission/ death were recorded, in which 2 of them were fatal.

below 18 years)


In week 1, one case of severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication/ death
involving a 2-year-old girl who had developed status epilepticus was reported. She is now



In the United States (week ending Dec 27, 2014), the influenza activity continued to
increase, with influenza A(H3N2) being the most predominating virus.
In Canada (week ending Dec 20, 2014), laboratory detection of influenza sharply increased
in past five weeks. Influenza A(H3N2) continues to be the most common type of viruses.
In the United Kingdom (week ending Dec 28, 2014), the weekly influenza consultation
rates remained elevated in England and Wales, but remained low in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
In Europe (week ending Dec 28, 2014), the proportion of influenza virus-positive sentinel
specimens increased to over 10%. The influenza season in Europe appears to be starting.
In Singapore (week ending Jan 3, 2015), the number of consultations for acute respiratory
infections remained low.

Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jan 14, 2015)
Reporting period: Jan 4 – 10, 2015 (Week 2)







The overall influenza activity has continued to increase. The predominating virus is
influenza A(H3N2).
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 2, 2015. As of Jan 14, there were 37 cases of
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 10 of them were fatal.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 6,
2014.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2013-15
In week 2, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 6.2 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza-like illness surveillance among
sentinel private doctors, 2013-15
In week 2, the average consultation rate for ILI
among sentinel private doctors was 51.8 ILI cases
per 1,000 consultations (Figure 2).

Influenza-like illness outbreak monitoring,
2014-15
In week 2, 25 ILI outbreaks occurring in schools/
institutions were recorded. In the first 4 days of
week 3 (Jan 11 to 14, 2015), 26 ILI outbreaks
occurring in schools/ institutions were recorded
(Figure 5).

Rate of influenza-like illness syndrome
group in accident and emergency
departments, 2013-15#
In week 2, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 186.2 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).
#Note: The influenza-like illness syndrome group includes codes such as
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission
rates and deaths based on discharge
coding, 2013-15
In week 2, hospital admission rates with principal
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0-4 years,
5-64 years and 65 years or above were 1.40, 0.14
and 1.68 cases (per 10,000 people in the age group)
respectively (Figure 7). Weekly number of deaths
with any diagnosis of influenza in public hospitals
is also shown in the figure on the right hand side.

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care
centres/ kindergartens, 2013-15
In week 2, 0.60% of children in the sentinel child
care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had fever
(Figure 8).

KG, 2013-15

Fever surveillance at sentinel residential
care homes for the elderly, 2013-15
In week 2, 0.17% of residents in the sentinel
residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) had
fever (Figure 9).

Enhanced Surveillance for Severe Seasonal Influenza (Aged 18 years or above)


From Jan 8, 2015, 12:00 noon, to Jan 14, 2015, 12:00 noon, 22 cases of influenza

Global Situation of Influenza Activity










In the United States (week ending Jan 3, 2015), the influenza activity continued at
elevated levels, with influenza A(H3N2) being the most predominating virus.
In Canada (week ending Jan 3, 2015), laboratory detection of influenza remained elevated.
Influenza A(H3N2) continues to be the most common type of viruses.
In the United Kingdom (week ending Jan 4, 2015), the weekly influenza-like illness
consultation rates increased in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but remained stable
in Scotland.
In Europe (week ending Jan 4, 2015), the influenza season has started. The number of
countries with increased influenza activity continued to rise compared to those in
previous weeks. The proportion of influenza virus-positive sentinel specimens increased
to 16%%.
In Singapore (week ending Jan 10, 2015), the number of consultations for acute
respiratory infections remained low.

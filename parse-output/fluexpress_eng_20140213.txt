Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Feb 12, 2014)
Reporting period: Feb 2 – 8, 2014 (Week 6) 




The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity remained at a high 
level. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or 
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 3, 2014. As of Feb 12, there were 116 cases of 
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 45 of them were fatal. 
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high‐risk individuals and even healthy persons. 
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members 
of the public. 
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or 
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, 
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors 
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2, 
2013. 

Influenza‐like‐illness surveillance among 
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012‐14 
In week 6, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 7.1 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza‐like illness surveillance among 
sentinel private doctors, 2012‐14 
In week 6, the average consultation rate for ILI 
among sentinel private doctors was 59.5 ILI cases

Percent positive for influenza viruses, 
2013‐14 
For the respiratory specimens received between 
Jan 27 to Feb 2, 2014, 24.2% were tested positive 
for influenza viruses, including 11.6% influenza

Influenza‐like illness outbreak monitoring, 
2013‐14 
In week 6, 4 ILI outbreaks occurring in schools/ 
institutions were recorded. In the first 4 days of 
week 7 (Feb 9 to 12, 2014), 3 ILI outbreaks 
occurring in schools/ institutions were recorded

Rate of influenza‐like illness syndrome 
group in accident and emergency 
departments, 2012‐14# 
In week 6, the rate of the influenza‐like illness 
syndrome group in the accident and emergency 
departments (AED) was 240.7 (per 1,000 coded 
cases) (Figure 6). 
#Note: The influenza‐like illness syndrome group includes codes such as 
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and 
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission 
rates and deaths based on discharge 
coding, 2012‐14 
In week 6, hospital admission rates with principal 
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0‐4 years, 
5‐64 years and 65 years or above were 3.01, 0.18 
and 0.89 cases respectively (per 10,000 people in 
the age group) (Figure 7). Weekly number of 
deaths with any diagnosis of influenza in public 
hospitals is also shown in the figure on the right 
hand side.

deaths, 2012‐14

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care 
centres/ kindergartens, 2012‐14 
In week 4, 1.27% of children in the sentinel child 
care centres / kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had fever 
(Figure 8). The surveillance from week 5 to 6 was 
suspended due to Chinese New Year holiday.

care homes for the elderly, 2012‐14 
In week 6, 0.10% of residents in the sentinel 
residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) had 
fever (Figure 9).

Enhanced Surveillance for Severe Seasonal Influenza (Aged 18 years or above) 


From Feb 5, 2014, 12:00 noon, to Feb 12, 2014, 12:00 noon, 27 cases of influenza 
associated ICU admission/death were recorded, in which 9 of them were fatal. In addition,

Surveillance of severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication/death (Aged 
above one month and below 18 years) 


In week 6, two cases of severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication/death 
involving a 1‐month‐old boy and a 10‐year‐old boy were reported. They had developed 
encephalopathy and acute myocarditis respectively. The 1‐month‐old boy who had his 
nasopharyngeal aspirates tested positive for influenza A(H1) is now in stable condition, 
whereas the other case who was tested positive for influenza B had been discharged. In 
the first 4 days of week 7 (Feb 9 to 12, 2014), there were no new reports of severe 
paediatric influenza‐associated complication/death. 
Note: The data reported are provisional figures and subject to further revision.

Surveillance of Tamiflu resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection 


In week 6, one new report of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
virus infection involving an 1‐year‐old boy was reported. He had been discharged. The 
virus strain detected was sensitive to zanamivir (Relenza). In the first 4 days of week 7 
(Feb 9 to 12, 2014), there were no new reports of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistant influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. There are totally 45 reports of Tamiflu resistant influenza 
A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detected in Hong Kong since 2009. 

Global Situation of Influenza Activity


In the United States (week ending Feb 1, 2014), influenza activity remained high with 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 the predominating virus. 



In Canada (week ending Feb 1, 2014), overall influenza activity continued to decrease, 
with most activity identified in eastern provinces. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus remains 
the most common virus circulating this season. 



In the United Kingdom (week ending Feb 2, 2014), the weekly influenza consultations 
remained low in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 



In Europe (week ending Feb 2, 2014), ILI consultation rates increased in most countries in 
the Region, but started to decrease in Bulgaria, Spain and Turkey, whose influenza 
seasons started earlier. 



In Singapore (week ending Feb 8, 2014), the number of consultations for acute respiratory 
infections slightly decreased compared wtih past two weeks.

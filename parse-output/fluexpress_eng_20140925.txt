above), who are eligible, can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from
enrolled private doctors participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy
schemes starting from Oct 6, 2014.

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 38, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 3.3 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Reporting period: Oct 27 – Nov 2, 2013 (Week 44) 
The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity had returned to 
baseline level since it started to increase in late July. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or 
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jul 26, 2013. As of Nov 1, there were 56 cases of 
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 36 of them were fatal. 
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high‐risk individuals and even healthy persons. 
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members 
of the public. 
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or 
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, 
will be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors 
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2, 
2013.

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2011‐13 
In week 44, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 2.8 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Dec 30, 2014)
Reporting period: Dec 21 – 27, 2014 (Week 52)


The latest surveillance data showed that the overall influenza activity has increased, indicating
the arrival of the winter influenza season.
From January 2, 2015 onwards, the Centre for Health Protection will collaborate with public
hospitals under the Hospital Authority and private hospitals to reactivate the enhanced
surveillance for severe seasonal influenza, that is cases of influenza-associated admissions to the
intensive care unit or deaths aged 18 or above, during the winter influenza season to further
monitor the severity of illness as in previous influenza seasons.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons. Except
for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or child
care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, can be
subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors participating in the
Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 6, 2014.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 52, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 5.4 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza-like illness surveillance among
sentinel private doctors, 2012-14
In week 52, the average consultation rate for ILI
among sentinel private doctors was 32.6 ILI cases
per 1,000 consultations (Figure 2).

Among the respiratory specimens received in
week 52, 0.52% was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09,
7.41% influenza A(H3), 0.24% influenza B and

Influenza-like illness outbreak monitoring,
2013-14
In week 52, 4 ILI outbreaks occurring in schools/
institutions were recorded. In the first 3 days of
week 1, 2015 (Dec 28 to 30, 2014), 6 ILI outbreaks
occurring in schools/ institutions were recorded
(Figure 5).

Rate of influenza-like illness syndrome
group in accident and emergency
departments, 2012-14#
In week 52, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 184.3 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).
#Note: The influenza-like illness syndrome group includes codes such as
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission
rates and deaths based on discharge
coding, 2012-14
In week 52, hospital admission rates with principal
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0-4 years,
5-64 years and 65 years or above were 0.82, 0.04
and 0.46 cases (per 10,000 people in the age group)

Fever surveillance at sentinel child care
centres/ kindergartens, 2012-14
In week 51, 0.67% of children in the sentinel
child care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had
fever (Figure 8). The surveillance in week 52 was
suspended due to Christmas holiday.

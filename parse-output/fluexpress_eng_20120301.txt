The latest surveillance data showed that the overall influenza activity has 
continued to increase.

there were 49 cases of influenza associated ICU admissions or deaths, in which 30 
of them were fatal. 
As the winter influenza season is expected to last for a few more weeks, target 
groups are advised to make use of the last opportunity to receive influenza 
vaccinations.

FLU EXPRESS
Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jan 22, 2014)
Reporting period: Jan 12 – 18, 2014 (Week 3) 




The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity continued to 
increase. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or 
deaths (aged 18 years or above) since Jan 3, 2014. As of Jan 22, there were 40 cases of 
influenza associated ICU admission or death, in which 12 of them were fatal. 
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high‐risk individuals and even healthy persons. 
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members 
of the public. 
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or 
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, 
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors 
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2, 
2013. 

Influenza‐like‐illness surveillance among 
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012‐14 
In week 3, the average consultation rate for 
influenza‐like illness (ILI) among sentinel general 
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 5.9 ILI cases per 
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza‐like illness surveillance among 
sentinel private doctors, 2012‐14 
In week 3, the average consultation rate for ILI

Rate of influenza‐like illness syndrome 
group in accident and emergency 
departments, 2012‐14# 
In week 3, the rate of the influenza‐like illness 
syndrome group in the accident and emergency 
departments (AED) was 198.2 (per 1,000 coded 
cases) (Figure 6). 
#Note: The influenza‐like illness syndrome group includes codes such as 
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and 
pneumonia.

rates and deaths based on discharge 
coding, 2012‐14 
In week 3, hospital admission rates with principal 
diagnosis of influenza for persons aged 0‐4 years, 
5‐64 years and 65 years or above were 3.08, 0.19 
and 0.63 cases respectively (per 10,000 people in 
the age group) (Figure 7). Weekly number of 
deaths with any diagnosis of influenza in public 
hospitals is also shown in the figure on the right 
hand side.

centres/ kindergartens, 2012‐14 
In week 3, 1.04% of children in the sentinel child 
care centres / kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had fever 
(Figure 8).

A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection involving a 17‐month‐old boy and a 4‐year old boy were

zanamivir (Relenza). In the first 4 days of week 4 (Jan 19 to 22, 2014), there were no new 
reports of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. There

Surveillance of severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication/death (Aged 
above one month and below 18 years) 


In week 1, there were no new reports of severe paediatric influenza‐associated 
complication/death. In the first  4  days of week 2 (Jan 8 to 11, 2012), one case of 
severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication involving a 2‐year‐old boy was

In week 1 and the first 4 days of week 2 (Jan 8 to 11, 2012), there were no new reports of 
oseltamivir (Tamiflu) resistant influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus infection. There are totally 16

Global Situation of Influenza Activity


In the United States (week ending Dec 31, 2011), influenza activity increased but 
remained relatively low. 



In Canada (week ending Dec 31, 2011), the ILI consultation rate increased compared to 
previous weeks but remained within expected levels for this time of year. 



In the United Kingdom (week ending Jan 1, 2012), influenza activity remained low in 
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 



In Europe (week ending Dec 31, 2011), the ILI consultation rate was at low level in the 
region. However, the percentage of sentinel samples that were influenza positive 
increased during the previous two weeks, which may indicate the start of the influenza 
season. 



In Singapore (week ending Dec 31, 2011), the number of consultations for acute 
respiratory infections was below the warning level.

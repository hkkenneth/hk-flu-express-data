and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Aug 20, 2014)
Reporting period: Aug 10 – 16, 2014 (Week 33)

The overall influenza activity has returned to the baseline level.
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths aged 18 years or above between Jun 23 to Aug 18. During the enhanced
surveillance period, a total of 31 cases of influenza associated ICU admission or death
were recorded, in which 17 of them were fatal.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes.

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 33, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 3.7 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 117.1 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).

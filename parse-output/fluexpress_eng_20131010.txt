Reporting period: Sep 29 – Oct 5, 2013 (Week 40) 
The latest surveillance data showed that the local influenza activity remained elevated. 
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and 
private hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or

child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, 
will be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors 
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 2,

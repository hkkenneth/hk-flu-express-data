Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jul 16, 2014)
Reporting period: Jul 6 – 12, 2014 (Week 28)

The overall influenza activity in this week was similar to that in last week. The influenza
activity in the recent two weeks has decreased slightly when compared to that in
mid-June but was still higher than May.
The CHP has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and private hospitals to reactivate
the enhanced surveillance of influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or
deaths aged 18 years or above since Jun 23. As of Jul 16, there were 17 cases of influenza
associated ICU admission, in which 9 of them were fatal.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons.
Except for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members
of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or
child care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible,
can be subsidised for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors
participating in the Government's vaccination subsidy schemes.

sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2012-14
In week 28, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 3.9 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

group in accident and emergency
departments, 2012-14#
In week 28, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 144.1 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).

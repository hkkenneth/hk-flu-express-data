Flu Express is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office of the Centre for Health Protection. It monitors
and summarizes the latest local and global influenza activities.

Local Situation of Influenza Activity (as of Jan 28, 2015)
Reporting period: Jan 18 – 24, 2015 (Week 4)

The overall influenza activity has continued to increase and rapidly reached a high level
comparable to the peak levels in previous seasons with high activities. Nonetheless, it may
further increase.
The predominating virus is influenza A(H3N2).
The Centre for Health Protection has collaborated with the Hospital Authority and private
hospitals to monitor influenza associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions or deaths (aged 18
years or above) since Jan 2, 2015. As of Jan 28 noon, there were 122 cases of influenza
associated ICU admission or death, in which 64 were fatal cases. In the past week (Jan 18-24), 44
cases were recorded. Separately, one case of severe paediatric influenza infection (aged below
18 years) was recorded in the same period. A total of 45 severe cases among all age groups were
recorded in the past week, which was more than the highest weekly number of 33 recorded
during influenza seasons since 2011.
The hospital admission rate of influenza among elderly aged 65 years or above was at a high
level, exceeding the highest levels recorded in the past few years.
Influenza can cause serious illnesses in high-risk individuals and even healthy persons. Except
for those with contraindications, influenza vaccination is suitable for all members of the public.
Children (aged between six months and less than 6 years, or attending a kindergarten or child
care centre in Hong Kong) and elderly (aged 65 years or above), who are eligible, can be
subsidized for seasonal influenza vaccination from enrolled private doctors participating in the
Government's vaccination subsidy schemes starting from Oct 6, 2014.

Influenza-like-illness surveillance among
sentinel general outpatient clinics, 2013-15
In week 4, the average consultation rate for
influenza-like illness (ILI) among sentinel general
outpatient clinics (GOPCs) was 9.4 ILI cases per
1,000 consultations (Figure 1).

Influenza virus detections (Laboratory
surveillance), 2014-15
Among the respiratory specimens received in
week 4, 1336 (30.96%) were tested positive for
seasonal influenza viruses, including 2 influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09, 1295 influenza A(H3) and 39
influenza B (Figure 3).

Among the respiratory specimens received in
week 4, 0.05% was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09,
30.01% influenza A(H3) and 0.90% influenza B
(Figure 4).

Influenza-like illness outbreak monitoring,
2014-15
In week 4, 55 ILI outbreaks occurring in schools/
institutions were recorded. In the first 4 days of
week 5 (Jan 25 to 28, 2015), 68 ILI outbreaks
occurring in schools/ institutions were recorded
(Figure 5). The outbreaks in the past four weeks
mainly occurred in primary schools (34%),
residential care homes for the elderly (32%) and
kindergartens or child care centres (15%).

Rate of influenza-like illness syndrome
group in accident and emergency
departments, 2013-15#
In week 4, the rate of the influenza-like illness
syndrome group in the accident and emergency
departments (AED) was 235.4 (per 1,000 coded
cases) (Figure 6).
#Note: The influenza-like illness syndrome group includes codes such as
influenza, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough, throat pain, and
pneumonia.

Influenza associated hospital admission
rates and deaths based on discharge
coding, 2013-15

In week 4, admission rates in public hospitals with
principal diagnosis of influenza for persons aged
0-4 years, 5-64 years and 65 years or above were
2.92, 0.23 and 3.79 cases (per 10,000 people in the
age group) respectively. The hospital admission
rate of influenza among elderly aged 65 years or
above is at a high level, exceeding the highest
levels recorded in the past few years (Figure 7).

care centres/ kindergartens (CCC/ KG) had fever
(38°C or above)(Figure 8).

Surveillance of severe influenza cases


In the past week (Jan 18-24, 2015), a total of 45 severe cases were recorded, which was more
than the highest weekly number of 33 recorded during influenza seasons since 2011 (Figure 11).

Surveillance of severe paediatric influenza-associated complication/death (Aged
below 18 years)


In week 4, one case of severe paediatric influenza‐associated complication involving a 2-year-old

positive for influenza A(H3).. In the first 4 days of week 5 (Jan 25 to 28, 2015), four cases of
severe paediatric influenza‐associated complications were reported. The first case was a
16-year-old girl who has developed pneumonia. The second case was a 6-year-old girl who had
developed encephalitis. The third case was a 2-year-old girl who had developed severe
pneumonia and shock. The last case was a 3-year-old girl who had developed pneumonia and
shock. The respiratory specimens of all the cases were tested positive for influenza A(H3).
Note: The data reported are provisional figures and subject to further revision.



In the United States (week ending Jan 17, 2015), the influenza activity might have peaked as the
percentage that tested positive for influenza viruses stood at 31.4% in the last week of 2014 and
dropped to 19.5% in the week ending January 17.
In Canada (week ending Jan 17, 2015), the percentage that tested positive for influenza viruses
peaked at 34.6% in the last week of 2014 and then decreased to 29.5% in the week ending
January 17. Canada recorded 118 outbreaks of influenza A in long-term care facilities in the week
ending January 17, compared with 125 in the previous week.
In the United Kingdom (week ending Jan 18, 2015), the percentage that tested positive for
influenza viruses in England reached a peak of 31.7% in the first week of 2015 and decreased to
19.4 per cent in the week ending January 18.
In Europe (week ending Jan 18, 2015), the percentage that tested positive for influenza viruses in
Europe continued to increase from 28% in the week ending January 11 to 40% in the next, which
is over the threshold of 10%.
In Japan (week ending Jan 18, 2015), the average number of reported ILI cases per sentinel site
rose from 3.49 in the first week of last December to 37.0 in the week ending January 18, far
higher than the baseline level of 1.00.
In Taiwan (week ending Jan 17, 2015), the percentage that tested positive for influenza viruses
